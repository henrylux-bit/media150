<h2>Creative Statement</h2>
<p>I believe life is a creative process that is continuously changing. Once intention is applied to something in one's reality, it becomes something new. Destruction can create space for new ideas just as creation gives birth to new forms.</p>
<p>I work with digital and film photography as a way to explore the world around me. I am interested in how photography can move between different photographic and printing processes to evolve into new work and meaning. I enjoy photographing still life, street photography portraits, and documenting my life as a father. Fatherhood is important to me and photographing it helps me understand what it means to me over time.</p>
<p>Alongside photography, I also work with music through DJing and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/turntablism" target="_blank">turntablism</a>. I enjoy mixing and remixing music, scratching on beats, and beat juggling as another form of creative expression. Through this class I hope to build a website to host and share my photography and other work and to learn how working in a digital space can change the way I see and present my ideas.</p>
