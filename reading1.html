<h2>Reading One</h2>
<p> Before reading Sontag, I believed photography was not that special because almost 
     everyone has a camera, and since phones are always in our pockets, I felt that anyone
     could do what I was doing. I also struggled to see my own pictures as art. Photography 
     felt more like a technical skill or a convenient tool than a way of thinking about the 
     world. I cared about composition and light, but I did not fully understand how
      photographs evoke meaning.
</p>
<p>Sontag says that photographs feel like “pieces of reality” rather than interpretations, and
     when I first read that, it really clicked for me. When I look at a picture, my instinct is 
     to believe, “this is exactly what happened.” But thinking more about it, I’ve realized that a 
     photograph compresses the world into  a 2D image. It documents only one angle, one 
     instant in time, and one choice made by the photographer, so what looks like reality is 
     only a piece of it.
</p>
<p>One video I saw online really stuck with me. The camera angle and focal length made it 
     look like a man was sprinting toward a woman to rob her. But when more of the clip 
     played, I realized he was actually running to help her. That moment showed me how 
     fast  anyone can jump to conclusions just from what we see.
</p>
<p>Creating a photo book on Mixbook.com was another time that made me think about 
     photography as an art form. I had to think carefully about sequencing, pacing, and how 
     images worked together. I wondered how a viewer might skim through the book and 
     stop on certain photographs. This process felt closer to storytelling.
</p>
<p>My experiences with different photography professors also shaped how I see things. 
     One professor really wanted our photos to look almost like the examples, which pushed 
     me to be precise. Another professor gave instructions but also encouraged us to bring 
     in images we liked and experiment. Going through both approaches helped me realize 
     that photographers are always making choices based on the aesthetic they are looking 
     for.
</p>
<p>After watching the docudrama Minamata by Andrew Levitas, I saw more clearly how a 
     photo essay (visual storytelling) can actually shift political outcomes. In the film, a
     fishing village suffers for years from mercury poisoning while the government and 
     corporations  ignore them. What moved things were the photographs taken by W. 
     Eugene Smith. His images made the suffering visible to people who had no idea 
     what was happening. For me, this showed that photography can create public awareness and 
     stir outrage.
</p>
<p>Thinking about this today, Sontag’s warning about being addicted to images feels true to 
     me. With things like Meta Ray‑Ban smart glasses, people can record almost all the time, 
     without anyone realizing it. I’ve started to notice how sometimes people help strangers 
     on camera not just out of kindness, but because they want a moment they can post 
     online. That makes the camera feel closer to the “ray gun” Sontag talks about the tool of 
     power that shapes how we act and how we perform in public.
</p>
<p>Overall, reading In Plato’s Cave continued to make me realize how powerful  and how 
     easily abused photography can be. I still enjoy making images, but I also see that 
     photographs are never neutral. Instead of just “recording” the world, photos help shape 
     how we understand it and how we remember it.
